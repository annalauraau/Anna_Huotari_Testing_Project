> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the web app was a good experience. It made me realize how even small issues, like a typo, can impact how users perceive the application. It was also a great way to practice identifying and reporting bugs clearly.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I started by understanding the feature I was testing and figuring out the issue. Then I wrote down all the steps needed to reproduce the bug and noted what I expected versus what actually happened. I kept the test case organized so it was easy to follow.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - Yes, I think tools like Jira or TestRail could be helpful because they make it easy to track and manage test cases. 


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- no


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I didn’t have trouble with GitHub because I’ve used it before in other projects. 
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would use Selenium with Python because it’s great for automating web testing.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Knowledge of automation tools like Selenium or Cypress.
- Programming skills in Python, Java, or JavaScript.
- Experience with version control systems like Git.
- Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines.
- Strong problem-solving and communication skills.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
Technical Skills:

- Learning an automation tool like Cypress or Selenium.
- Gaining experience in performance testing with tools like JMeter.
- Getting better at database querying with SQL.
- Practicing API testing using tools like Postman.

Soft Skills:

- Communication and teamwork.
- Problem-solving and attention to detail.
- Time management and flexibility.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- This project was very helpful for applying what I’ve learned in theory to a real-world task. It showed me how to write test cases, find bugs, and report them in a structured way. I feel like it improved my understanding of testing workflows and helped me build confidence.
